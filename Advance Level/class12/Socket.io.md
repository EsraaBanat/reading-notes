# Socket.io

### **Socket.IO** is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts − a **client-side library** that runs in the browser, and a **server-side library** for node.js. Both components have an identical API..

#### **A real-time application** (RTA) is an application that functions within a period that the user senses as immediate or current.

- Some examples of real-time applications are

    - **Instant messengers** − Chat apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc. You need not refresh your app/website to receive new messages.

    - **Push Notifications** − When someone tags you in a picture on Facebook, you receive a notification instantly.

    - **Collaboration Applications** − Apps like google docs, which allow multiple people to update same documents simultaneously and apply changes to all people's instances.

    - **Online Gamin**g − Games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty, etc., are also some examples of real-time applications.

- There are some reserved events, which can be accessed using the socket object on the server side.

    These are:

    - Connect
    - Message
    - Disconnect
    - Reconnect
    - Ping
    - Join and
    - Leave


###  Difference Between WebSocket and Socket.io:

**WebSocket** is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection; WebSocket remains open all the time, so they allow real-time data transfer. When clients trigger the request to the server, it does not close the connection on receiving the response; it rather persists and waits for the Client or server to terminate the request.

**Socket.IO** is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface. Generally, it is divided into two parts; both WebSocket vs Socket.io are event-driven libraries.

- Client-Side: it is the library that runs inside the browser
- Server Side: It is the library for Node.js
