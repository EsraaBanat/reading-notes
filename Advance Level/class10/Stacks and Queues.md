# Stacks and Queues

## **Stacks**

**Stack:** is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Common terminology for a stack is:

1. `Push` - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2. `Pop` - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
3. `Top` - This is the top of the stack.
4. `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
5. `IsEmpty` - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### Stacks follow these concepts:

**FILO**

**F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

**LIFO**

**L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

**Push O(1)**

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top.

**Pop O(1)**

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a pop. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

**Peek O(1)**

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

## **Queue**

Common terminology for a queue is:

1. `Enqueue` - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. `Dequeue` - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. `Front` - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. `Rear` - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. `IsEmpty` - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

Queue is FIFO and LILO

**Enqueue O(1)**

When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

**Dequeue O(1)**

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

**Peek O(1)**

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you want to check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
